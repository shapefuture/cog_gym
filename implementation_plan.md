# Implementation Plan: Gemini Gateway

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Gemini Gateway application, focusing on user authentication, chat interface, Gemini API integration, and free access implementation.

## 1. User Authentication (OAuth 2.0)

**Goal:** Authenticate users using Google Sign-In with OAuth 2.0 to access the Gemini API on their behalf.

**Steps:**

1.  **Google Cloud Project Setup:**
    *   Create a Google Cloud Project.
    *   Enable the Generative Language API.
2.  **OAuth Consent Screen Configuration:**
    *   Configure the OAuth Consent Screen in the Google Cloud Project.
    *   Choose "External" as the User Type.
    *   Fill in required app information (App name: Gemini Gateway, User support email, Developer contact information).
    *   Add the following scopes:
        *   `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/generative-language` (Critical for Gemini API access)
        *   `email` (For basic user identification)
        *   `openid` (For basic user identification)
    *   Add authorized domains (e.g., your application's domain).
    *   Add authorized redirect URIs (where Google sends the user back after authentication).
3.  **OAuth Client ID Creation:**
    *   Create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID credential in your Google Cloud project.
    *   Choose the "Web application" application type.
    *   Configure authorized redirect URIs to match the ones in the OAuth Consent Screen.
4.  **Frontend Implementation (Next.js):**
    *   Install the necessary libraries for Google Sign-In (e.g., `firebase` for simplified OAuth flow or a custom OAuth implementation).
    *   Implement a "Sign in with Google" button that initiates the OAuth 2.0 flow.
    *   Redirect the user to Google's OAuth 2.0 authorization endpoint with the required parameters:
        *   `client_id`: Your OAuth 2.0 Client ID.
        *   `redirect_uri`: Your authorized redirect URI.
        *   `scope`: `"email openid https://www.googleapis.com/auth/generative-language"`
        *   `response_type`: `code`
        *   `access_type`: `offline` (for refresh tokens)
        *   `include_granted_scopes`: `true`
        *   `state`: A unique, non-guessable value.
5.  **Backend Implementation (Next.js API Route or Server Actions):**
    *   Create an API route or Server Action to handle the OAuth 2.0 code exchange.
    *   Upon receiving the authorization code from Google, exchange it for an access token and a refresh token (if requested) using a server-to-server POST request to Google's token endpoint (`https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token`). Include:
        *   `code`: The authorization code.
        *   `client_id`: Your OAuth 2.0 Client ID.
        *   `client_secret`: Your OAuth Client Secret (keep this secure).
        *   `redirect_uri`: Your authorized redirect URI.
        *   `grant_type`: `authorization_code`
    *   Securely store the access token, refresh token, and user's Google Cloud Project ID (more on this later).  Consider encryption.
6.  **Access Token Management:**
    *   Implement a mechanism to check the access token's expiration time.
    *   If the access token is expired, use the refresh token to obtain a new access token.

## 2. Chat Interface (UI)

**Goal:** Provide a user-friendly chat interface for interacting with the Gemini API.

**Components:**

1.  **Chat Container:** A container to hold the chat messages.
2.  **Message Bubbles:** Distinct message bubbles for user input and Gemini output.
3.  **Input Field:** A text input field for users to enter their prompts.
4.  **Send Button:** A button to send the prompt to the Gemini API.
5.  **Loading Indicator:** Display a loading animation while waiting for the Gemini API response.

**Styling:**

*   Use the specified color scheme:
    *   Primary color: White or light gray for background.
    *   Secondary color: Dark gray or black for text.
    *   Accent: Teal (#008080).
*   Ensure a clean and simple layout with good readability.
*   Use clear and recognizable icons for the send button and other actions.
*   Implement subtle animations for loading states and transitions.

## 3. Gemini Integration (GenAI)

**Goal:** Integrate with the Gemini API using the user's access token and Google Cloud Project ID.

**Steps:**

1.  **API Request Function:**
    *   Create a function to make requests to the Gemini API.
    *   Include the user's access token in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN`.
    *   **Crucially, include the `X-Goog-User-Project` header in the API request, setting its value to the user's Google Cloud Project ID.**  This is the key to attributing API usage to the user's account.
    *   Handle API errors and display appropriate messages to the user.
2.  **Data Handling:**
    *   Format the user's input as a prompt for the Gemini API.
    *   Parse the Gemini API response and display the output in the chat interface.

## 4. Free Access Implementation (OAuth 2.0 with User-Attributed Billing)

**Goal:** Provide free access to the Gemini API by enabling users to link their own Google Cloud projects for billing.

**Details:**

1.  **Google Sign-In Integration** [UI, Other]: Ensure Google Sign-In is correctly implemented and configured to request the necessary scopes.
2.  **Access Token Handling** [Other]: Securely store and manage user access tokens. Refresh tokens when necessary.
3.  **Gemini API Integration** [GenAI]: Utilize user access tokens to make requests to the Gemini API, including the X-Goog-User-Project header.
4.  **Conditional Project Linking** [UI, Other]: Implement a mechanism to prompt users to link their Google Cloud project if they want to use the service beyond the free tier. Provide clear instructions on how to find their Project ID.
5.  **Linking Project to User** [Other]: After the user provides the Project ID, validate it (check if billing is enabled, the Generative Language API is enabled, etc.) and store it securely, associated with their user account.
6.  **Error Handling** [UI, Other]: Gracefully handle errors, such as invalid Project IDs, disabled APIs, or billing issues, and provide informative messages to the user.

## 5. Implementation Details

*   **Technology Stack:**
    *   Next.js (Frontend and Backend)
    *   Tailwind CSS (Styling)
    *   Firebase (Optional, for simplified OAuth flow)
*   **Code Structure:**
    *   `src/app`: Next.js App Router structure
    *   `src/components`: Reusable UI components
    *   `src/lib`: Utility functions and API clients
    *   `src/ai`: GenAI-related code (prompts, flows)
*   **Security:**
    *   Securely store access tokens, refresh tokens, and Google Cloud Project IDs.
    *   Implement proper error handling and validation to prevent security vulnerabilities.
    *   Protect API keys and secrets.

## 6. Development Workflow

1.  **Setup**
    *   Create base NextJS application using the `create-next-app` command.
